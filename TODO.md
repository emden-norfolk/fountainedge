# Todo

* `:initial` [node shape](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html) to `circle` and `:final`
    node shape to `doublecircle` respectively if label is nil.
* Decision node (node with more than one out edge) shape `diamond`.
* ~~Hash (#) notation for tokens at the join node. Might be possible with [`xlabel`](https://graphviz.org/docs/attrs/xlabel/).~~ âœ“
* Neverending todo:
  * Document more examples.
  * Unit tests.
* Updating dependencies:
  * `graphvix` (requires Elixir version increase -- will be a minor release version therefore -- remember to set Elixir version in `mix.exs`.)
  * `decimal` (as above.)

## Validation

Validation will be a future feature if there is desire for it.
It will have functionality changes but largely remain backwards-compatible, so therefore it will be a minor release version.

Even though validation is not implemented yet, it would be a good idea to use this list as a guide for best practice.

Pass extra option into `initialise/2`. Raises exception?

`validation/1` gives a list of errors. Default to `:enforcing`.

Three error levels:

 * `:none` - No validation (use with care.)
 * `:enforcing` - Check for conditions that will break functionality, or are bad practice or against the original intention of the design.
 * `:strict` - Things that aren't nice or will just break rendering of the graph.

No intial node will always raise an exception, even with `:none`.

### Enforcing

 * Edges counts:
    * One edge into fork.
    * One edge out of join.
    * All nodes (other than initial and final) must have an in and out edge.
      *  Initial node at least one edge out.
      *  Final node at least one edge in.
    * Fork nodes must have at least two out edges.
    * Join nodes must have at least two in edges.
 * One initial node only.
 * At least one final node.
 * Nodes must have a unique identifier.
 * Check that forking nodes point to a valid join node.
 * Check all edges point to a valid node identifier.
 * Check for duplicate edges.

### Strict

 * One edge only out of initial.
 * No edge out of final node.
 * No edge into intial node.
